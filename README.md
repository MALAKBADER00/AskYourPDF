## How It Works in Detail

1. **PDF Text Extraction:**

   - **PyPDF2:**  The `read_pdf` function uses `PyPDF2` to extract text from each page of the PDF document. It iterates through all the pages, collects the text, and compiles it into a single string. This step is crucial for converting the PDF into a format that can be processed and analyzed.

2. **Text Segmentation:**

   - **CharacterTextSplitter:** The `split_text` function utilizes LangChain's `CharacterTextSplitter` to divide the extracted text into smaller chunks. This is necessary because processing the entire document at once can be inefficient and may exceed the model's input size limitations. The text is split into chunks of 800 characters with an overlap of 200 characters to ensure context is preserved across chunks.

3. **Building the FAISS Index:**

   - **OpenAI Embeddings:** The `create_faiss_vector_store` function creates embeddings for each text chunk using the OpenAI API. These embeddings are vector representations of the text chunks.

   - **FAISS:** These vectors are then stored in a FAISS index. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library designed to perform efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. This index allows for quick retrieval of similar text chunks when a query is made.

5. **Question Answering:**

   - **Semantic Search:** When a user asks a question, the get_answer function converts the query into an embedding and performs a semantic search on the FAISS index to find the most relevant text chunks.

   - **LangChain QA Chain:** The relevant chunks are then passed to the QA chain, which is powered by OpenAI's language model specified by the user's API key. This model uses the context provided by the retrieved text chunks to generate an accurate and contextually appropriate answer.
